  For over 15 years, I have been an educator and mentor in South Korea. My
  love for learning and internal motivation got me into tech.  I realized that
  I understood very little of the tech I used every day.

  Coding has been a hobby for the last 5 years.

  Besides sitting in front of a computer, you can find me running around my
  neighborhood or at the local driving range.  I have recently fallen back in
  love with running and found a new passion in golf.
