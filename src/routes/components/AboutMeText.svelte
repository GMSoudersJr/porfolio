  I'm an American living and working in South Korea.  After 15+ years of
  teaching English and mentoring youth, 7+ years of learning to code, and
  3+ years of experience mostly as a frontend developer, I've decided to
  switch completely to the digital realm.
</p>
<p>
  Coding has been a hobby for the last 5 years.

  Besides sitting in front of a computer, you can find me running around my
  neighborhood or at the local driving range.  I have recently fallen back in
  love with running and found a new passion in golf.
