    For over 15 years, I taught and inspired individuals in South Korea.
    However, my curiosity led me to explore the web and its vast possibilities.
    I took the plunge into the world of tech and code, and it has been an
    exhilarating journey. Starting with freeCodeCamp.org, I honed my skills in
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, earning a full-stack developer certification. My
    Python adventures included creating a report card comment generator using
    my own data. I dabbled in Django and React Native, even developing a
    delivery-sharing app. While not all projects received expected funding, I
    persisted. A Raspberry Pi introduced me to remote systems, and I delved
    into Linux, bash, vim, and terminal commands. Recently, I tackled React.js
    for a startup, implementing features and squashing bugs. My passion lies in
    automating tests, optimizing processes, and crafting efficient solutions
    with Svelte and Playwright.
    Letâ€™s create together!
