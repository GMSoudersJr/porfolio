    I‚Äôve been teaching and inspiring people in South Korea for more than a
    decade and a half. But I never stopped being a student myself. I always
    wanted to know more about the magic behind the web. So I decided to dive
    into the world of tech and code. And boy, was it deep! The more I explored,
    the more I realized how much there is to learn. And I love it! üòç
  </p>
  <p>
    My coding journey began on freeCodeCamp.org, where I acquired the essential
    skills of web development: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I applied these
    skills to create responsive web pages and applications, and earned a
    full-stack developer certification. But I was eager to learn more. I
    encountered Python, and used it to develop a report card comment generator,
    using my previous comments as data. I also experimented with Django and
    React Native, and developed a prototype of a delivery-sharing app. However,
    the app did not receive the funding we expected. Then I explored linux,
    bash, vim, tmux, config files, and terminal commands. I purchased a
    raspberry pi, and learned how to work on a remote system. Then I got an
    opportunity to work for a start-up that had funding. I inherited a code
    base and had to re-learn React.js, but I successfully implemented all the
    features they requested and eliminated a multitude of the bugs.

    I code to automate tasks and save time for myself and others. I look for
    patterns and opportunities to optimize processes that are tedious and
    time-consuming. Whether it is creating PO Sheets, invoices, or reports,
    I can design solutions that can handle them efficiently and accurately. I
    enjoy using my skills and creativity to solve problems and improve
    workflows. ü§ù

    Besides sitting in front of a computer, you can find me running around my
    neighborhood or grinding at my local driving range.  I have recently fallen back in
    love with running and found a new passion in golf.
